# Overview

The **AI-Powered Candidate Ranking System** is an intelligent recruitment assistant that helps recruiters identify the most suitable candidates from large datasets.

Traditional recruitment relies heavily on manual resume screening and keyword-based filtering, making hiring slow and inconsistent. This project automates candidate evaluation by analyzing multiple factors and generating an explainable AI-based ranking.

The system processes candidate profiles, calculates suitability scores, classifies candidates into different match categories, and generates a ranked shortlist for recruiters.

Challenges include:

* Manual resume screening
* Large candidate datasets

# Solution

The system evaluates candidates using multiple AI-inspired scoring factors:
